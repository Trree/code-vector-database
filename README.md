# Local Code Vector Database based on ChatGPT

## Introduction

ü§ñÔ∏è This project utilizes the fully open-source [milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus) to build a local code vector database, 
enabling local, personal, and company-level code vectorization. 
It supports the creation of function and feature-level code vector databases by parsing code files at the function level. 
It leverages ChatGPT to obtain the semantic meaning of functions and utilizes [Sentence-BERT](https://mccormickml.com/2019/05/14/BERT-word-embeddings-tutorial/) for word embeddings.


## Use Cases
- Building personal or company-level code vector libraries
- Uploading code files to establish function and feature-level code vector databases
- Searching for your own code using prompts
- Generating frameworks and code based on requirement documents
